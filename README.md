# mortgage_calculator
This is used for calculation on mortgage

See the example usage in main.py. We can get monthly pay before and after refinance (notice that we also need to pay for maintainence and etc, so multiple this by 1.3 to be sure you have positive cash flow). We can also get discounted to present pay.
